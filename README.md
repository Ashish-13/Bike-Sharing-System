# Bike-Sharing-System
Demand prediction in a bike-sharing system using machine learning techniques

## Abstract
Due to the low cost and flexible nature of Bike Sharing System there has been a significant increase of user in a short period. But the increasing popularity has also given rise to issues, affecting both users and bike operators. The key problem among which is the unequal distribution of bikes which is caused by fluctuating usage. Thus, efficient rebalance methods are required to effectively manage the requirements of bike at each station. In this research, I propose to consider both the temporalk and spatial properties to predict future demands. Since, unavailability of bikes at one station affects its neighbouring stations. To do that Graph Convolution Techniques are utilised which treats the data as a network of nodes and edges.
